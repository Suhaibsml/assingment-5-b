    <p>Gola Kebab, also known as Chapli Kebab, is a flavorsome delight originating from the Pashtun region of Pakistan. These kebabs are made with minced meat, often beef or lamb, mixed with a variety of spices, crushed red chili, and herbs. The mixture is then shaped into flat round patties and fried until they develop a crispy exterior while remaining juicy and moist on the inside. Gola Kebabs are renowned for their robust flavors, combining the earthy aromas of the spices with the hearty goodness of the meat.</p>
