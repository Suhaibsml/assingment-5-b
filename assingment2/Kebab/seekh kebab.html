    <p>Seekh Kebab is a classic and beloved kebab preparation that showcases the art of skewered grilling. Made with minced meat, such as beef or lamb, the meat is blended with a medley of spices, herbs, and onions. The mixture is then shaped into elongated cylinders on skewers and grilled over open flames, allowing the kebabs to acquire a smoky charred exterior and a tender, juicy interior. Seekh Kebabs are a testament to the rustic flavors and mouthwatering textures of Pakistani cuisine, making them a favorite at gatherings and barbecues.</p>
