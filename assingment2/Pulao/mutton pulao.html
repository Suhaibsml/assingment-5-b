    <p>Mutton Pulao is a classic dish that exemplifies the rich and tender qualities of mutton. Tender mutton pieces are marinated in a blend of aromatic spices, including cinnamon, cardamom, and bay leaves, infusing them with a depth of flavor. The marinated mutton is then cooked with fragrant basmati rice, allowing the rice to absorb the essence of the meat and spices. The result is a delectable pulao where the tender mutton and fragrant rice come together in a harmonious blend, creating a comforting and flavorsome dish.</p>
