    <p>Chicken Pulao offers a lighter and more delicate variation of the traditional pulao. Tender chicken pieces are marinated in a mixture of yogurt, ginger, garlic, and spices, adding a subtle tang and enhancing the flavors. The marinated chicken is then cooked with aromatic basmati rice, allowing the rice to absorb the flavors of the chicken and spices. The chicken pulao is a delightful combination of tender chicken, fragrant rice, and subtle spices, creating a flavorful and satisfying meal.</p>
