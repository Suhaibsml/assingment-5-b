    <p>Mutton Qorma is a regal and luxurious dish that showcases the tender and flavorful qualities of mutton. Succulent pieces of mutton are cooked in a rich and velvety gravy made with a blend of aromatic spices such as cloves, cinnamon, cardamom, and nutmeg. The slow cooking process allows the mutton to absorb the flavors, resulting in meat that is incredibly tender and infused with the rich spices. The creamy and indulgent texture of the qorma makes it a true delight to savor, offering a taste experience that is fit for royalty.</p>
