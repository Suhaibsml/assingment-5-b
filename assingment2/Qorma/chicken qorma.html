    <p>Chicken Qorma is a succulent and aromatic dish that brings out the delicate flavors of chicken in a creamy and fragrant gravy. Tender chicken pieces are marinated in a mixture of yogurt, ginger, garlic, and spices, allowing the flavors to penetrate the meat. The chicken is then cooked in a creamy and luscious gravy made with onions, tomatoes, and a blend of aromatic spices, such as cloves, cardamom, and cinnamon. The result is tender chicken that is infused with the rich and aromatic flavors of the qorma, creating a dish that is both comforting and satisfying.</p>
